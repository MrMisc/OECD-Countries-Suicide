# OECD-Countries-Suicide
Basic visual and linear regression analysis of suicide rates by country from 1960 to 2020 where available


# Results

Particularly, there are interesting trends you can see especially when you allow suicide rates to be truncated for particular periods. Especially from around 1995 to 2000 to present, 
suicide rates appear to be increasing at the greatest rate in the USA, not in typical places you would consider such as Korea. Granted, Korea does still have a positive
suicide rate per year (i.e. it increases every year still if results are truncated from about 2000 onwards). Australia and Turkey are also noteworthy in that regard.
